I cofounded the Alabama Biosciences Research Institute with Cody Gibson and Dr. Don Collier. 

Alabama Biosciences Research Institute existed to perform high-quality research in natural science. The researchers of ABRI represent many distinct disciplines in the natural sciences and STEM fields and implement an interdisciplinary approach to research.

### An Implemetation of Real-Time Wearable Monitoring of the Lower-Leg Edema Using Bioimpedance [Paper](https://louis.uah.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1837&context=honors-capstones)
### University Of Alabama Huntsville Louis
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. We propose a wearable sensor for continuous monitoring of edema in lower legs using bioimpedance. Bioimpedance devices are able to accurately measure Extra Cellular Water (ECW) and Total Body Water (TBW) using whole body measurements. This work details the implementation of a continuous real time, non-invasive wearable bioimpedance and activity monitoring system. The system collects a complex bioimpedance of the lower leg together with userâ€™s activity collected from an inertial sensor. The preliminary results indicate that activity state classification model achieved accuracy of 94.0% based on bioimpedance only. We plan to use the system for monitoring of lower leg edema throughout the day as a part of diagnostic analysis of heart failure patients.

### Assessment of Prehospital Monitor/Defibrillators for Clostridioides difficile Contamination [Paper](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/prehospital-and-disaster-medicine/article/abs/assessment-of-prehospital-monitordefibrillators-for-clostridioides-difficile-contamination/3A1FEA34A71EACB353EE05BBBBEDEA8C)
### Cambridge University Press

The purpose of this study was to determine if Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) was present on the electrocardiogram (ECG) right arm leads, blood pressure cuffs, and fingertip pulse oximetry sensors of monitor/defibrillators used in the prehospital setting. 

### Emergency Medical Services resource capacity and competency amid COVID-19 in the United States: preliminary findings from a national survey [Paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844020307453)
### Heliyon

This study aimed to investigate available resources, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) availability, sanitation practices, institutional policies, and opinions among EMS professionals in the United States amid the COVID-19 pandemic using a self-report survey questionnaire. 

### Emergency medical services oxygen equipment: a fomite for transmission of MRSA? [Paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30504457/)
### Emergency Medicine Journal

The primary purpose of this study was to determine if methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was present on the surface of oxygen cylinders and regulators used in the prehospital setting and secondarily to assess other surfaces for MRSA within the ambulance compartment, as a comparison.
